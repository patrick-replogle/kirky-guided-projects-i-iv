# Lambda Hubs Web API

Guided project for **Node API 1** Module.

In this project we will learn how to create a very simple Web API using `Node.js` and `Express`, and cover the basics of `server-side routing` and using global `middleware`.

The code for the guided project will be written in a single file for simplicity. We'll see ways to structure an API to make it more maintainable in upcoming lectures.

## Prerequisites

- a REST client like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download/) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) installed.

## Project Setup

- [ ] fork and clone this repository.
- [ ] **CD into the folder** where you cloned **your fork**.
- [ ] type `npm i` to download dependencies. This step is equivalent to using `yarn` for React Projects.

Please follow along as the instructor builds the API step by step.
